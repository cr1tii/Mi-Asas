A Discord pictures bot

this one of my Discord bots i made week ago so i decided to share a version from it with you guys.

its a simple discord bot that send pictures, or gifs.

you can use it to make a profile pictures , banners bot or a memes bot, he send clear pictures and gifs , likely 1080p , or idk tbh but its very clear.


you can re-use CD file to write a different commands and you can summon them in your discord server, i have like 4 commands , you can set all your commands in one channel, or all channels, but for me i use threads came from one channel.

make sure you got the permissions for your bot by adding him to the threads and channels or adding his role, and make sure you get your bot message permissions from discord developer portal.


you need to install these libraries first , for me I'm using Termux so i will tell you to install pip, after making sure you done set up python in your console:

discord.py
discord.ext

# this library to summon your discord token in your main file or miG file:

dotenv
